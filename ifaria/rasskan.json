  "backStory": [
    "Growing up, I had a unique connection to magic that I couldn't quite explain. From very young, strange things would happen to me. Once, I openned a door and when I went through, it put me back in the same room I just left. The first few times things like this happened, I chocked it up to confusion and moved on but when some more obvious things happened, I began to understand that I had a strange connection to magic that I could only dream of understanding. As I grew older, I started to gain more control over this connection. It was like I was developing a relationship with it. Magic eventually became so natural to me, like it was a part of me.",
    "Around 15 years old, I became very interested in books. I thought about the great Wizards of the area and all of the studying that they'd do and I thought that would be the key to understanding more about magic and would make me stronger. Little did I know, it was doing the exact opposite.",
    "During my studies, I began to learn new spells but it was becoming increasingly more difficult to do them. Even the ones that I'd been casting for years started behaving different. This was incredibly frustrating to me so I delved deeper into the books hoping that they would be the cure to what was going on with me. I spent nearly every day at the [Texts Ad Infinium] going over every text that I could find on spells. I was focusing on new spells but was getting nowhere with them. This became my crutch.",
    "After about a year of this, I began to give up and decided that magic might not be my calling. I began drifting toward different kinds of books, still with a focus on magic. Magic was all I really studied this point. After I stopped studying spells, my magical abilities starting coming back. I unconciously began using my magic as a part of my everyday life again. It was so natural that I didn't notice it at all.",
    "One day, while studying at [Texts Ad Infinium], I came across a few books that mentioned rumors of a secret magical school called Urekonia. After that, I became obsessed with finding out more about it. I began scowering texts and asking around to see if anyone knew anything. No one thought it was real. I thought that this school could help my unlock my potential and teach me how to grow more powerful. After asking around, the school took notice of me. They kept watch from a few to determine how much of a threat to their secrecy I was. I began being more brazen about my information gathering and they didn't like that. Urekonia made a decision to capture me before I could do any damage to their secret nature.",
    "During my capture, I began using magic the best that I'd ever used it. It all came so natural when I was acting out of instinct instead of trying to use my intelect. I'd developed a strong bond with magic that made it difficult for them to capture me. This, of course, lasted about 30 seconds but it felt like an eternity for me. Durint this fight, they saw what great potential I had with my magical talent. After some deliberation, they decided that the best way to keep me quiet was to take me in and train me. This would satisfy my need for more knowledge and allow them to breed another skilled sorcerer.",
    "Classes were everything that I hoped they'd be. My first few classes were about the differences in magic weilding beings. This made me understand why magic was so difficult for me coming out of a book but so easy when I stopped thinking about it during a fight. ",
    "Mentor is a Gem Dragon named Dragar. He's a teacher at Urekonia. After seeing how reckless I am, he gifted me a power that would protect me during battle."
